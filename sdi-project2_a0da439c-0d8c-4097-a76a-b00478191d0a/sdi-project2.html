<p>For this project I will be talking about a game I used to play called Starcraft. Starcraft is a real time strategy game. I will be coding what buildings I would build first, and the time it takes for the workers to build them. I picked this game because this was the game that I would come home from school and play. Also I picked it because when I would play the game I would lose track of time while having so much fun.</p>
